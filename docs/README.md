# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Docs. This README serves as the entry point for understanding and accessing all key process documents used for planning, executing, and improving projects at OctoAcme.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme's project management processes are structured around clear roles (PM, PdM, Developers, Stakeholders), a lifecycle from Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective, consistent workflows for reporting, risk management, QA/testing, and continuous improvement. There are regular communication and alignment checkpoints, and key artifacts such as project one-pagers, backlogs, risk registers, and retrospectives.

### Key Principles
- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and learning

### Project Lifecycle
1. **Initiation**: Problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Scope, resources, milestones, dependencies
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, iterate
4. **Release**: Deploy, verify, announce
5. **Retrospective**: Capture learnings and next steps
