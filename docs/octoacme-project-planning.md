# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. UX research and design discovery (for user-facing features)
4. Technical architecture review and design decisions
5. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
6. Define Definition of Done (DoD) including quality, security, and UX criteria
7. Identify dependencies and integration points
8. Security threat modeling and initial risk assessment
9. Create release plan and milestone map
