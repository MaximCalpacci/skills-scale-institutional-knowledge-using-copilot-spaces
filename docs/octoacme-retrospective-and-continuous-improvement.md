# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Include all key roles: PM, PdM, Developers, QA/Testers, UX/UI Designers, Technical Lead, Security Champion, and Support/Customer Advocate as appropriate
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Ensure diverse perspectives from all roles are heard and valued

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template

- Description:

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
- Encourage feedback from all roles including QA, UX, Security, and Support perspectives
- Use insights from customer feedback (via Support/Customer Advocate) to inform process improvements
